# Text Encryptor

This web application provides a simple interface for encrypting and decrypting text using a custom encryption algorithm. The application is designed to be user-friendly, with an emphasis on ease of use and accessibility. Users can enter text into a textarea and choose to either encrypt or decrypt the input with the click of a button. The application handles only lowercase letters without accents, ensuring smooth processing.

### Features

+ **Text Encryption and Decryption:** Users can easily encrypt or decrypt their input text by clicking the corresponding button.

+ **User Interface**

    + **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts gracefully to different screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
    + **Animations:** Subtle animations enhance user experience, including a rotation animation for the logo and slide animations for text input and output areas.

+ **Footer:** A fixed footer contains copyright information and links to social media profiles, staying at the bottom of the page for easy access.

+ **Technology Stack:**

    + **Frontend:** HTML and CSS are used to create a clean and responsive design.
    + **JavaScript:** Handles encryption and decryption logic.

    "gato" => "gaitober"
    "gaitober" => "gato"
    ```


- The page must have fields for inserting the text to be encrypted or decrypted, and the user must be able to choose between the two options.
